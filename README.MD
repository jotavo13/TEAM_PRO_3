# ECHO - A Video Library 

# About:
ECHO is a full-stack application that utilizes CRUD functionality as well as a react front-end.  This application serves as a library for users to save and categorize videos from youtube. 

## User Stories
- User has the ability to create an account
- User creates a new youtube video by searching for the title and then clicking on one of the videos that we populate from the API. (we expect to show the first 10 most related videos to the input title)
- User has the ability to create, update and delete categories.
- User can add videos from their library, and then view videos from each category. 
- User can add videos using a search bar that will populate tht first 10 matching videos and allow them to select one. 
- User can view all of the videos that they have added to their profile. (We want to mimic youtube as much as possible with thumbnails, titles, views, time uploaded, etc.)
