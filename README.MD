# Youtube Library 

# About:
Youtube Library (name pending) is a full-stack application that utilizes CRUD functionality as well as a react front-end. 

## User Stories
- User has the ability to create an account
- User creates a new youtube video by searching for the title and then clicking on one of the videos that we populate from the API. (we expect to show the first 10 most related videos to the input title)
- User has the ability to create, update and delete saved youtube videos.
- User can view all of the videos that they have added to their profile. (We want to mimic youtube as much as possible with thumbnails, titles, views, time uploaded, etc.)
- User can create categories for the videos to be added to? Maybe we auto add categories based on the API data?
- User has a nav bar that includes a favorite section, watch later section, etc. where they can further organize their videos.
